## Business Perspective
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers alike. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial to prevent financial losses and maintain customer trust. From a business perspective, implementing an effective fraud detection system not only safeguards the company's assets but also protects customers from potential financial harm and reinforces their confidence in the brand. By leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Decision Trees, financial institutions can automate the detection process, enabling real-time monitoring and swift response to suspicious activities. This not only reduces the impact of fraud but also optimizes operational efficiency and enhances overall risk management practices. Accurate fraud detection ultimately fosters a secure environment for financial transactions, ensuring the integrity of the financial system and sustaining long-term business growth.
